- **Grid Provider**: Your grid operator name
- **Supplier**: Your electricity supplier name

### Cost Configuration
Configure your local electricity costs in ‚Ç¨/kWh:
- Grid excise duty, renewable charges, transmission prices (day/night)
- Supplier renewable charges and margin
- VAT percentage and per-component VAT flags

### Time Settings
- **Night tariff hours**: Define when night prices apply (default: 22:00-07:00)
- **Update intervals**: Data refresh frequency (default: 1 hour)
- **Cheap hours calculation**: Daily recalculation time (default: 15:00)

### Cheap Hours Analysis
- **Base price**: Reference price for cheap hour calculations (‚Ç¨/kWh)
- **Threshold**: Percentage above base price still considered "cheap"

## üîß Sensors & Entities

The integration provides comprehensive sensor data:

### Price Sensors
- **Current Price**: Real-time electricity price including all components
- **Current Tariff**: Active tariff (day/night) based on your configuration
- **Hourly Prices**: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow price series

### Analysis Sensors  
- **Cheap Hours**: Number of cheap hours in upcoming periods
- **Next Cheap Hours Start/End**: When the next cheap period begins/ends
- **Last Sync**: When price data was last updated

### Control Entities
- **Cheap Hours Threshold**: Adjustable threshold percentage
- **Cheap Hours Base Price**: Adjustable base price for calculations
- **Calculate Cheap Hours**: Manual recalculation button

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Dual Coordinator Architecture
- **Price Coordinator**: Handles Nord Pool data fetching and caching
- **Cheap Hours Coordinator**: Manages cheap hours analysis and scheduling

### Smart Scheduling
- Automatic midnight updates for date transitions
- Configurable daily recalculation of cheap hours
- DST and timezone transition handling

### Transparent Calculations
All price components are clearly separated and configurable:
```
Total Price = Nord Pool + Grid Costs + Supplier Costs + VAT
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration not appearing**
- Ensure HACS is installed and configured
- Check that the repository was added as "Integration" category
- Restart Home Assistant after installation

**No price data**
- Verify your area code is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check internet connectivity
- Nord Pool API may have temporary outages

**Incorrect cheap hours**
- Verify base price and threshold settings match your expectations
- Check that calculation time allows for complete price data
- Use the manual "Calculate Cheap Hours" button for immediate updates

### Debug Logging
Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.real_electricity_price: debug
```

## üîÑ Recent Updates (v1.0.0)

- **Fixed cheap hours threshold calculation**: Corrected formula ensuring accurate identification
- **Fixed cheap hours sensor state**: Now shows total hours instead of number of ranges
- **Enhanced calculation transparency**: Analysis now spans multiple days with future periods
- **Improved midnight transition handling**: Native Home Assistant time tracking
