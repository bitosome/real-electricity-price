   ./scripts/dev-setup.sh
   ```

3. **Access Home Assistant at http://localhost:8123**

### Daily Development
1. **Make changes to integration files**
2. **Sync and test:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/sync-integration.sh
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```
3. **Check code quality:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/lint.sh
   ```

### Before Committing
```bash
./scripts/lint.sh      # Format and lint code
./scripts/test.sh      # Run all tests
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## 🐳 Docker Commands

The development environment provides these useful commands:

```bash
# View logs
docker logs hass-real-electricity-price-test --tail 50 -f

# Restart Home Assistant
docker restart hass-real-electricity-price-test

# Stop environment
docker compose down

# Access container shell
docker exec -it hass-real-electricity-price-test bash
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Script Not Executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Docker Issues
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker ps

# Check container logs
docker logs hass-real-electricity-price-test
